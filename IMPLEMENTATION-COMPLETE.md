  - **Hotels**: Check-in/out times, meal inclusions, amenities
  - **Activities**: Duration, group size, highlights
  - **Transfers**: Pick-up/drop-off locations, vehicle type
  - **Meals**: Dining experiences, cultural information

#### 4. **Library Usage Analytics**
- âœ… Real-time statistics on library utilization
- âœ… Track percentage of library items being used
- âœ… Monitor library-to-itinerary conversion rates
- âœ… Visual progress bars and usage metrics

#### 5. **Integration Management Panel**
- âœ… View all library items used in current itinerary
- âœ… Quick access to remove library-based events
- âœ… Usage count for each library item
- âœ… Direct links to view original library items
